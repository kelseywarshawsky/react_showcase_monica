<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is the beginning of Monica Dominguez's work produced out of our mentorship agreement. We meet multiple times each week to discuss React and work on React-based projects. All work is solely Monica's, with the goals assigned by me and code reviewed by me (Kelsey Warshawsky). This is a mixture of several tutorials and projects to put what was learned in those tutorials directly into action. 

### About the Authors
Monica Dominguez is a multidisciplinary artist learning to code. She studied in Kansas City's LaunchCode Women+ program in 2023 and is now seeking additional expertise and confidence. She is seeking junior engineer work at this time.
I am Kelsey Warshawsky, a senior software engineer with five years of experience in React, Node, etc, as well as 4 years of experience teaching in bootcamps. As you can see I really enjoy mentoring, and Monica is my main mentee this year.
